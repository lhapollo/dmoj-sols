My solutions from [https://dmoj.ca](url). My user: [https://dmoj.ca/user/subcluster](url)

Problems are ranging in difficulty from about 7 points and above, from many different organizations and contests like DMOPC, CCC, COCI, and more.

Topics range from simple implementations, to graph theory, to dynamic progamming, and more.

Just putting my code here so I don't lose it, and maybe it helps somebody in need one day, but maybe not because I'm so washed ;-;

Enjoy!
