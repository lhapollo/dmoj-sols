# dmoj-sols
my code from problems on dmoj.ca with problems from CCC, DMOPC, and more.
I'm probably going to upload all my old code, and then add some more files in the future as I do more problems. 

It's likely that I only add problems that get harder and harder (7 points and over on DMOJ) because I don't wanna waste time doing simpler problems because they're already too easy. Unless it's for a contest like CCC, then I may do it for practice.
